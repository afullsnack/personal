# What is it?

This repo holds my personal webiste/portfolio with content hosting and managemnt as well as enables interested people to subscribe to my newsletter where I send out snippets and tit-bits around knowledge and experiences I came accross in the last 2 weeks.

## How does it work?

The repo was scaffolded from the T3 stack, pioneered by Theo, if you're not familiar with it check it out its great for using nextjs fullstack capabilities to quickly get up and running.

## How is it deployed?

It is deployed to my hobby plan on vercel. I think vercel is pretty great and straight forward for handling deployments, especially nextjs application deployments. Of course it can handle deployments from other frameworks, like angular, vue, solid e.t.c.

With that said welcome to the repo holding the [afullsnack.dev](https://afullsnack.dev) website.
